# LangGraph Toolbox Agent (Responses Protocol)

A LangGraph ReAct agent that connects to an **toolbox in Microsoft Foundry** via MCP and
serves responses over the Foundry Responses Protocol.

## How It Works

1. On startup the agent calls `client.get_tools()` against the Toolbox MCP endpoint.
2. A `create_react_agent` is built from the loaded tools and an Azure OpenAI LLM.
3. Incoming requests are handled by `ResponsesAgentServerHost` on port `8088`.
4. The agent is initialized **lazily** (once, on the first request) and reused for all
   subsequent turns — the MCP client is kept alive to prevent session garbage-collection.
5. When the toolbox requires OAuth consent (e.g. a GitHub connection that hasn't been
   authorized yet), the MCP server returns error code `-32006`. The agent detects this,
   logs the consent URL, and surfaces it to the caller via a fallback tool instead of
   crashing.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- A Microsoft Foundry project with a toolbox already created — see
  [`../sample_toolboxes_crud.py`](../sample_toolboxes_crud.py) to create one
- Azure CLI installed and logged in:

  ```bash
  az login
  ```

## Quick Start (Local)

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# 1. Copy and fill in the environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT, MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME,
#              and TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT at minimum

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Start the agent
python main.py

# 4. Invoke
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "What tools do you have?"}'
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# 1. Copy and fill in the environment file
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT, MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME,
#              and TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT at minimum

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Start the agent
python main.py

# 4. Invoke
Invoke-RestMethod -Method POST http://localhost:8088/responses `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"input": "What tools do you have?"}'
```

## Deploy as a Hosted Agent

### Setup

#### 1. Install Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
winget install microsoft.azd
```

See the [full installation docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) for other options.

#### 2. Install the AI Agents azd extension

```bash
azd extension install azure.ai.agents
```

To upgrade the extension later:

```bash
azd extension upgrade azure.ai.agents
```

#### 3. Log in to Azure

```bash
azd auth login
```

#### 4. Fix git CRLF setting (Windows only)

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

### Quick Start (Deploy with azd)

> **IMPORTANT:** The `-m` (or `--manifest`) flag is **required** for `azd ai agent init`.
> It tells the command where to find your agent definition and source files.
>
> `-m` can point to either:
> - **A specific `agent.manifest.yaml` file** — init copies all files from the same directory as the manifest
> - **A folder containing `agent.manifest.yaml`** — init copies all files from that folder

```bash
# 1. Create a new directory and initialize the agent project
mkdir my-langgraph-agent && cd my-langgraph-agent
PROJECT_ID="/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>"
azd ai agent init \
  -m /path/to/samples/python/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/responses/langgraph-toolbox/agent.manifest.yaml \
  --project-id $PROJECT_ID \
  --no-prompt \
  -e my-env

# 2. Set required environment variables
azd env set enableHostedAgentVNext "true" -e my-env
azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME "gpt-4o" -e my-env  # must match the deployment name in azure.yaml

# 3. Provision infrastructure and deploy the container
azd up -e my-env

# 4. Invoke the deployed agent (run from the scaffolded project directory)
azd ai agent invoke --new-session "What tools do you have?" --timeout 120
```

### Post-Init Checklist

After `azd ai agent init`, perform these steps before `azd up` will work:

| # | Action | Why |
|---|--------|-----|
| 1 | `azd env set enableHostedAgentVNext "true"` | Without this, container health probes fail |
| 2 | Edit `src/<agent>/agent.yaml`: replace all `${{VAR}}` with `${VAR}` | Init scaffolds broken double-brace syntax that is NOT resolved at deploy time |
| 3 | Verify `agent.yaml` uses **flat format** (`kind: hosted` at root) | The nested `template:` format silently fails during deploy |
| 4 | `azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME "<deployment-name>"` | Must match the deployment `name` in `azure.yaml`; platform injection is unreliable without this (container crashes on startup) |
| 5 | Verify `main.py` checks `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` first | Platform injects this var, NOT `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` |
| 6 | **If using existing project with AppInsights already connected:** `azd env set ENABLE_MONITORING "false"` | Provision fails with duplicate App Insights connection error |
| 7 | **If model region ≠ RG region:** edit generated `infra/main.parameters.json` — change `aiDeploymentsLocation` value from `${AZURE_LOCATION}` to `${AZURE_AI_DEPLOYMENTS_LOCATION}`, then `azd env set AZURE_AI_DEPLOYMENTS_LOCATION "<region>"` | Init templates map model deployment location to `AZURE_LOCATION` which is wrong when model is in a different region |

### What `azd ai agent init` Does

`azd ai agent init` copies all source files (main.py, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, etc.) **verbatim** from the manifest directory into `src/<agent-name>/` in the scaffolded project. It does NOT generate or modify main.py — it copies the exact file from your manifest.

The init command also:
- Creates `azure.yaml` with service config, connections, and toolbox definitions
- Creates `infra/` directory with Bicep templates
- Creates `.azure/<env>/.env` with environment variables

### Project Structure

After `azd ai agent init`, you get:

```
my-project/
├── .azure/
│   └── <env-name>/
│       ├── .env              # Environment variables (auto-populated by azd)
│       └── config.json       # Subscription + location config
├── infra/
│   ├── main.bicep            # Top-level Bicep template
│   ├── main.parameters.json  # Parameters (references .env values)
│   └── core/ai/
│       ├── ai-project.bicep  # Project + connection deployment
│       └── connection.bicep  # Connection resource template
├── src/
│   └── <agent-name>/
│       ├── agent.yaml        # Agent definition (env vars, protocols)
│       ├── main.py           # Agent code
│       ├── Dockerfile        # Container build
│       └── requirements.txt  # Dependencies
└── azure.yaml                # azd service + toolbox configuration
```

> **Tip:** `azd ai agent invoke` must be run from the scaffolded project directory
> (the directory where `azure.yaml` was created by `azd ai agent init`).  
> The `--timeout 120` flag is recommended — agent cold starts can take up to 60 seconds.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | **Yes** | Project endpoint URL — platform-injected at runtime |
| `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | **Yes** | Model deployment name (e.g. `gpt-4.1`) |
| `TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT` | **Yes** | Full toolbox MCP endpoint URL including toolbox name and api-version |
| `FOUNDRY_AGENT_TOOLBOX_FEATURES` | No | Feature-flag header value — platform-injected (default: `Toolboxes=V1Preview`) |

`TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT` is the full pre-constructed MCP URL. Two forms are supported:
```
# Latest version:
https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>/toolboxes/<name>/mcp?api-version=v1

# Pinned to a specific version:
https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>/toolboxes/<name>/versions/<version>/mcp?api-version=v1
```
The version number is the integer toolbox version (e.g. `1`). Use the versioned form to pin to a known-good version.

## Supported Toolbox Tools

See [../SUPPORTED_TOOLBOX_TOOLS.md](../SUPPORTED_TOOLBOX_TOOLS.md) for all supported
tool and auth types. For runnable SDK creation examples, see
[../sample_toolboxes_crud.py](../sample_toolboxes_crud.py).

## Protocol

This sample uses the **Responses Protocol** (`azure-ai-agentserver-responses`):
- OpenAI-compatible `/responses` endpoint on port `8088`
- Streaming SSE output
- Multi-turn conversation (history fetched automatically)
- 240-second per-request timeout

## Troubleshooting

### Agent starts but returns no tools

Check that `TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT` is set and the toolbox exists. The URL must include
`?api-version=v1`.

### OAuth consent required

If a toolbox connection requires OAuth (e.g. GitHub), the agent logs:
```
OAuth consent required. Open the following URL in a browser to authorize...
```
Open the URL, complete the OAuth flow, then restart the agent. Until consent is granted,
the agent returns a `oauth_consent_required` tool message to callers.

### Tool call failures don't crash the agent

`handle_tool_error = True` is set on all loaded tools, so MCP tool errors are returned
as tool messages rather than raising exceptions that would break conversation state.

### Tool schemas rejected by OpenAI

The agent sanitizes malformed schemas from MCP servers (missing `properties` on
`object`-type schemas). If you see `400 Invalid tool schema` errors, check the raw
tool schema returned by your MCP server.

### `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` vs `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`

The platform injects `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`. The code also accepts
`AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` for backward compatibility, but always prefer the `FOUNDRY_`
variable in new deployments.

## Tracing

The `azure-ai-agentserver-core[tracing]` package is included in `requirements.txt` and
provides OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation for LLM calls, MCP tool invocations, and
server spans. Traces can be exported to Azure Monitor (Application Insights).

### Enable Azure Monitor export

**Locally:** set `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` in `.env`:

```bash
# Get the connection string from your Application Insights resource in the Azure Portal
# (Settings → Properties → Connection String)
APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=InstrumentationKey=<key>;IngestionEndpoint=...
```

**When deployed:** the platform automatically injects `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`
from the Application Insights resource linked to your Foundry project. No additional
configuration is required.

### View traces in Azure Monitor

Once `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is set:

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open your Application Insights resource.
2. Navigate to **Investigate** → **Transaction search** to see individual traces.
3. Use **Investigate** → **Application map** for an end-to-end dependency view.

Traces include LLM calls, tool invocations (including MCP calls to the toolbox), and
server spans. Each conversation turn produces a linked trace tree rooted at the
incoming `/responses` request.

### agent.yaml Format

```yaml
kind: hosted          # MUST be at root level
name: toolbox-langgraph-agent
protocols:
  - protocol: responses
    version: 1.0.0
environment_variables:
  - name: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
    value: ${AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}     # Single-brace syntax
  - name: AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
    value: ${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
```

> **WARNING:** Do NOT use the nested `template:` format — `azd deploy` silently ignores it.  
> Do NOT use `${{VAR}}` double-brace syntax — the container receives the literal string.

### Toolbox Configuration

The toolbox is configured in `azure.yaml` (generated by `azd ai agent init`). You can add toolbox definitions under `config.toolboxes` in `azure.yaml`. See the [azd README](../azd/README.md) for supported toolbox scenarios.

### Monitoring

```powershell
# View container logs
azd ai agent monitor --tail 50
```

### Known Issues

See [../azd/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](../azd/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for all known issues with azd toolbox deployments.
